  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I’m an engineering student at Manipal Institute of Technology, pursuing Communication and Computer Engineering with a strong interest in autonomous systems, embedded electronics, and AI.
    My experience includes developing path-tracking controllers using ROS 2 and C++, building intelligent systems with Arduino and sensors, and applying data analysis and Azure tools to real-world projects. I enjoy combining hardware and software to create practical, problem-solving solutions across domains like mobility, health tech, and automation.  </p>
  <p>
    Through internships with Microsoft, Formula Manipal, and Electrium Mobility, I’ve contributed to advanced vehicle control, sensor integration, and embedded product design. I also bring experience in public speaking, STEM outreach, and cross-functional leadership from organizing TEDx events and founding Binary Brainery.
